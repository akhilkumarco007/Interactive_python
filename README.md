# Interactive_python

These are the basic projects I worked on while learning python. They are basically a set of games which run on a web browser. 

The list of the games:
1. Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard and Spock
2. Guess the Number
3. Memory
4. Pong
5. Stop Watch Game
6. Black Jack

To make these games work, use any web browser. Go the URL: http://www.codeskulptor.org/ and clear the script on the left tab of the screen. 
Copy the script of the any of the games mentioned above in the clear space and then click on the play(left most) button on the top to execute the program. The game shows up a new browser window.


Have Fun!
